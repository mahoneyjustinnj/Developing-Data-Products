## Determining your Body Mass Index (BMI) 

Body Mass Index uses your weight and height to give a relative measure of your body fat.

It is calculated by taking you weight (in kilograms) and dividing it by the square of your height (in meters)

In the following application, you will enter you weight in pounds (lbs) and your height in centimeters (cm). 
The application is running on:
